I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in the [Parallel Architecture, System, and Algorithm Lab](http://pasalabs.org) at University of California, Merced supervised by Prof. [Dong Li](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/dong-li/). I graduated from school of computer science at Beijing institute of Technology in 2017, where I earned my Bachelor of Computer Engineering. 

Research
======

I work on computer systems for large-scale applications such as cloud computing services, data analytics, and machine learning. The goal of my research is to improve the performance and resource efficiency of cloud computing while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications. My research interests span operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning.
