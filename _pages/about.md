I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Parallel Architecture, System, and Algorithm Lab](http://pasalabs.org) at the University of California, Merced supervised by Prof. [Dong Li](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/dong-li/). Before coming to UC Merced, I received my B.S. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology. 

I will be an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [the College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/) starting Fall 2022.

Research
---- 
My research focuses on developing practical techniques to solve memory management issues in parallel computing systems, particularly in developing runtime support on heterogeneous memory systems.

The goal of my research is to improve the performance and resource efficiency of heterogeneous memory systems while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications. My research interests span operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning and high performance computing (HPC).
