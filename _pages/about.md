I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [the College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/). I received my Ph.D. from the University of California, Merced, supervised by Prof. [Dong Li](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/dong-li/). I received my B.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology. 

My research interests span **operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning and high-performance computing**. My research aims to improve the performance and resource efficiency of heterogeneous computing systems while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications.
