I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in the [Parallel Architecture, System, and Algorithm Lab](http://pasalabs.org) at the University of California, Merced supervised by Prof. [Dong Li](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/dong-li/). Before coming to UC Merced, I received my B.S. degree from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2017. Here is my [CV]().

Research
---- 
My research focuses on developing practical techniques to solve memory management issues in parallel computing systems, particularly 
in developing runtime support on heterogeneous memory systems.

The goal of my research is to improve the performance and resource efficiency of heterogeneous memory systems while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications. My research interests span operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning.
