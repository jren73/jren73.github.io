I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in the [Parallel Architecture, System, and Algorithm Lab](http://pasalabs.org) at University of California, Merced supervised by Prof. [Dong Li](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/dong-li/). I graduated from school of computer science at Beijing institute of Technology in 2017, where I earned my Bachelor of Computer Engineering. 

Research Interest
---- 
My research focuses on developing practical techniques to solve memory management issues in parallel computing systems, particularly 
in developing runtime support on the heterogeneous memory system.
The goal of my research is to improve the performance and resource efficiency of heterogenous memory systems while making it easier for users to deploy and manage their applications. My research interests span operating systems, computer architecture, and their intersection with machine learning.
